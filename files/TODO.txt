String variables containing paths
Progresive probability of finding certain stuff
terrain extender beyond limits (big numbers)
gui bar for shininess & specularStrength
Function for normals generation (and more encapsulations?)

Pixel area (border's normals) (different LOD areas joints)

Bug:   terrainGenerator terrX = (worldChunks.chunkDict[k]);     // double free or corruption (!prev)
Class encapsulation of OpenGL functions
ImGui
Light cast
IS SAND REFLECTING CORRECTLY??
Compute MVP matrices only once
Pass parameters to the shader as uniforms (instead of hard-coding them in the shader)
Single VAO for all chuncks

terrainChunks:
        (X) Fog
        ( ) Don't show non-visible chunks
        ( ) Low level of detail far away
	( ) When fixing borders normals, don't compute noise again if it can be taken from the chunk next to it
	(X) Rounded area
	(X) Follow the camera
	(X) Don't send again to GPU already sent chunks
	(X) Hay acumulaci√≥n de chunks creciente al avanzar?? No lo es
	(X) Encapsular terrain rendering
	(X) Ommit first terrain creation
